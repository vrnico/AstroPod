->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## ASC

An ascendant in Aries gives off the appearance of a natural initiator. People may look towards you when they are ready to
start new projects in their lives. There is a straightforward energy at play here that seems to center you as a protagonist in most events. Good advice would be to not let it go to your head.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## SUN

An Aries Sun placement is representative of an energy that places ego and identity at the forefront. This is the sunrise of the zodiac, and the solar Aries vitality is the rooster that crows with it. You surely awaken the vigor within other signs, and base a lot of your self-worth on your ability to keep the fire burning. A naturally-cast hero within your own story, you respond to fast-paced circumstances in ways that most couldn't keep up with.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MOON

Aries Moon is a sign reserved for those who invest their emotion into new beginnings. Blank canvases, creating new solutions to old problems, and starting from scratch are your calls to action. You feel most comfortable in situations that allow you space to grow and express yourself naturally. You may feel unnecessarily stifled by those who oppose your progress, or get in your way. Learning from past failure is key to success in most situations.


->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MERC

A Mercurian Aries placement points towards an individual who is concerned with the cutting-edge. Aries Mercury is able to mix physical energy with cerebral pursuits. This archetype may be channeled as a physical learner, someone who is able to grasp concepts through tactile reinforcement and muscle memory.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## VENUS

Venus in Aries represents someone who places their aesthetic worth in their physicality and the quality of their physical energy levels. This is a placement that may be channeled through health-consciousness, or a sort of addiction to high-energy engagements.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MARS

Mars is the natural ruler of Aries. This placement represents a fierce and warrior-like presence. Your physical energy is prioritized as one of your greatest skillsets. It is of utmost necessity to practice your own agency within the structure of your life, you aren't likely to allow others to make decisions for you. This placement demands expansive environments and patient communities, as they may be prone to easy frustrations.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## JUPITER

The Aries Jupiter placement speaks to an energy that focuses on expanding one's physical pursuits. A person with Jupiter Aries may have a tendency to assume their view of the matter is the most efficient. Good advice for this placement is to consider all options before diving headfirst into unknown territories. Jupiter Aries is inclined to making hasty decisions before evaluating the entire scenario. First is not always best. The early bird gets the worm, but the early worm gets the bird.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## SATURN

A Saturn Aries placement represents an energy that prioritizes initiative over efficiency. This energy is best symbolized as the measured decision that brings an event into being. Saturn in Aries prides itself off its skills when working with a blank slate. This energy is an "Ideas Person", the initial spark that takes charge of new beginnings and drives a point across.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## URANUS

Uranus Aries, in our lifetime, affects those born between 1927-1934, and more recently 2010-2018. Uranus in Aries is represented as the catalyst to a new paradigm, the psyche's equivalent of the Big Bang, an energy that transcends old norms to pave way for the new. These periods are as much a venue for turmoil and strife, as they are for creative renaissances and scientific / spiritual break-throughs.



# TAURUS

## SUN

Sun in Taurus is an archetype focused in the tangible presence of this earth. This energy
is channeled as hands-on, comfort seeking, physically focused, and generally easy to deal with.
Taurus Sun points towards an individual who is resource focused, and in some cases dependent
on the bounty presented to them through their environment or their community. Ruled by Venus,
unevolved Sun in Taurus hazards between being stand-offish / stubborn, or annoyingly complacent. In its
prime, Taurus Sun is an easy-going, loving and thoughtful energy.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MOON

Taurus Moon marks a natural creature of comfort. This archetype affects it's vessel by creating a craving
for tangible tranquility. This could be embodied as somebody who creates resources in which others find
comfort, or as someone who is in a constant state of relaxation. At its worst, this energy can present
a sort of apathy towards labor. A heightened sense for the physical state, this person may have a natural
eye for aesthetic as it concerns subjects of a multi-dimensional matter. In other words, this person may
have an excellent sense of structural knowledge. 

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MERC

Mercury in Taurus is a physical, intellectual energy that can be channeled as an enhanced spatial reasoning.
Taurus Mercury communicates through the tangible realm, utilizing physical objects as props for broadcasting
their thoughts. Mercury in Taurus is a tactile learner, having to work with the earthy energy of Taurus in 
order to get a point across. 


->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## VENUS

Venus rules both Taurus and Libra. In Taurus, Venus represents a sort of self-love, a distinguished personal- aesthetic,
and a desire to comfort others and to be comforted.

SUN

Sun in Gemini represents an energy that is adaptable, innovative, and somewhat chaotic.
Gemini is ruled by Mercury, and as the planet of communication dictates this sign's archetype,
those with this placement follow suit. Writing, communication technology, creative arts, and anything
in the realm of thought broadcasting are of great importance to Gemini Sun. The dualistic nature of
this sign has less to do with being two-faced, and more to do with gaining understanding of both
sides of the coin. Some will cast off Geminian energy as being hypocritical, while others will celebrate
their ability to flawlessly change course with the winds that suit them.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## SUN

Sun in Cancer embodies an archetype of intuition and worldly empathy. A natural mother's instinct
is at the heart of this placement, as they put great care into the things that they are passionate about.
The symbol of the crab can be seen as both a protective shield, or a source of disguise, either way it is
hard to pin down the true intentions of this archetype, as it is wrought with self-denial, insecurity, and
the need to second guess. Ruled by the moon, Cancer energy courses with the prevailing tides, they may be excellent
sources of peace in moments of chaos.

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## MOON

The Moon is Cancer's natural ruler. Moon in Cancer represents somebody who is intune with their lunar energy.
This archetype is punctuated by a inherent intuition for the emotional needs of oneself and others around them.
At its peak this energy can represent an innate empathetic ability to channel knowledge of the psyche into all
forms of existence. Unevolved Moon in Cancer is prone to projecting their emotional landscape onto others, and 
various social pratfalls, a product of their insecurity.

SUN

Leo Sun pits itself at the center of the zodiac. This archetype is one of loud and royal energy
that coaxes even the most reserved walks of life out of hiding. The symbol of the Lion presents a two
sided coin. Evolved Leo Sun can be elegant and sophisticated, calling attention to the affordances
of their energetic lifestyle. Unevolved Leo Sun can be wrathful and territorial, a subject to scarcities
present or self-inflicted. Either way this archetype is one that breathes life into otherwise dull
situations, the true embodiment of the celestial master of ceremonies.

satiating their craving for uncommon experiences.

# CAPRICORN

## SUN

Capricorn Sun is an archetype that is represented by its deterministic output. Sun in Capricorn
desires to create tangible change through measured action and real progress. Though masters at actualization, Capricorn Sun can also be a source of grave stress, over-exhaustion, and the foundations of burnout culture. Regardless of the 
wound up nature of this archetype, Capricorn is an energy that represents the responsibilities and pursuits of the cellestial seeker in a constant state of advancement.

# PISCES

->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
## SUN

Pisces Sun is represented as the journey into the abyss for the purpose of self-awareness. The watery
and subjective strengths of the Piscean archetype allow those with this placement to float in waters
that others may drown in. Sun in Pisces is prone to bouts of dissociation, and may need to look at 
matters more objectively, when their thoughts stray to the abstract. A natural creative energy, Pisces
Sun is able to translate aspects of our collective unconcious and create structures from confusing
symbols that others may not even be aware of.
